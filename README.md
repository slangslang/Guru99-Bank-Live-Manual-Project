*(Add a brief description of what the demo illustrates.)*

## 🎯 Project Background
Utilized the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document to align the testing process with various versions of the AUT. This ensured comprehensive coverage of functionalities across the application.

## 🔍 Testing Methodology
- **Unit Testing**: Created and executed unit test cases to verify individual components' functionality and ensure they met the defined requirements before integration with other parts of the application.
- **Integrated Testing**: Conducted integrated tests to ensure all components worked together seamlessly, following the integration test plan provided by the development team.
- **System Test Plan**: Outlined the testing strategy for overall system validation.
- **System Testing**: Performed testing to validate all system components' functionality.

## 📊 Test Cases and Execution
- Collaborated with the development team to create test cases based on the upcoming modules of the banking site.
- Developed and maintained test cases using **Google Sheets**.
- Executed tests on the AUT and updated results in the test case sheet accordingly.
- Ensured thorough retesting of all failed test cases and bug/defect resolutions in newer versions of the website.

## 🐞 Bug Tracking
- Created a **bug tracker** within Google Sheets to document all bugs and defects found during testing, including those identified during exploratory testing.

## 🔗 Integrated and System Testing
- Executed integrated tests to ensure all components worked together seamlessly.
- Followed the integration test plan provided by the development team for systematic validation.

## 📜 Change Logs
Maintained and updated change logs throughout the testing process to document any modifications and the status of test cases and defects.
